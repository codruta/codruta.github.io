floyd | a new game begins with 7 players composed of 1 werewolf, 1 seer, 1
floyd | mafia, and 4 villagers.  now it is night; time for the werewolf to
floyd | kill, the seer to identify, the mafia to kill and the rest to sleep.
floyd | thrax, a villager, grins up at you from a lifeless skull.
floyd | it is now day. time to vote on whom to lynch.
thrax exclaims, "drat!"
josh_g says, "again, the same person?  woot"
schep says, "huh, it happened again."
brenbarn says, "hmmm."
josh_g asks, "so, like, who's the seer?"
miseri is, for once, nothing special.
jdoe says, "not me"
jota asks (of josh), "isn't it a bit early for that?"
brenbarn says, "wait, would that -- yeah."
josh_g says (to jota), "is it?  thought we'd need to do the same thing as last"
josh_g says, "but, my brane is dull tonight"
schep says, "even if they kill two tonight, we still live, so maybe not."
jota says (to josh), "well, i'm sure if an imposter appears, the seer will speak up..."
schep says, "there are more players."
josh_g says, "oh ok"
josh_g says, "never mind, i missed that we have an extra person"
josh_g says, "let the random mob violence begin, i guess"
jota asks, "so why would these people *both* hate thrax?"
miseri says, "could be a lawyer thing."
schep says, "heh"
jota says, "i understand the natural tendency to despise me and seek my death, as happened last time, but i'm not sure-- oh, right. the lawyer thing."
brenbarn says, "check who's on #thrax-sux"
josh_g says, "thrax is a lawyer?  there goes my pity ;)"
jota asks, "is thrax officially a lawyer nowadays?"
jota says, "why, i remember way back when he was just a law student, studying for exams..."
schep says, "i think he said he was a recorder or clerk or something."
josh_g says, "old coot stories, jota must be the werewolf"
brenbarn asks, "old coot=werewolf?"
thrax says (to jota), "bar exam is this winter."
schep asks (of josh), "would you stop that?"
josh_g says, "ok, i'm just being random here"
jota asks (of schep), "a larval lawyer?"
jota says (to thrax), "aha..."
josh_g says, "hee hee"
thrax says, "presently clerk for judge."
josh_g says (to schep), "you know, i get that a lot, and i'm never sure what i should be stopping"
josh_g says, "presumably, talking.  but you never know"
josh_g says (to bren), "heh"
josh_g says, "ok, i was hoping someone else would initiate the random mob violence, but if we're all gonna sit around i'll do it myself"
schep says, "wait"
brenbarn says, ">initiate random mob violence"
josh_g asks, "wha?"
josh_g asks, "got a plan?"
schep says, "there is that confusion at the beginning."
josh_g says (to schep), "sure, because we have no clear facts to go on"
josh_g says, "really, you have to start randomly"
schep says, "tends to suggest jdoe and miseri are *probably* innocent, but they could of course be lying."
brenbarn asks, "who would be most likely to pick the same person as someone else?"
schep says, "and josh_g we don't really know about, although he started the asking."
josh_g says, "and schep is ... well, i dunno, but someone's gotta suggest him since he won't :)"
miseri asks, "hey, would i lie about who i am?"
miseri says, "wait, don't answer that...."
brenbarn says, "then there's the wily jota."
josh_g says, "hee"
schep says, "well, i was listing probably innocent people."
schep says, "feel free to add me to that list ;)"
(from josh_g) schep says, "while i know for a fact that i'm guilty"
schep says (to josh_g), "hey, no."
josh_g says, "hee hee"
josh_g says (to schep), "sorry, it just flowed too nicely"
(from brenbarn) schep says, " . .nny nonny and a ho-ho-ho"
josh_g says, "and hmm jota is surprisingly quiet"
jota says (to josh), "sorry, talking in other window."
josh_g says, "sure, sure"
brenbarn says, "hrmrmmrm. . ."
schep says, "actually, he has been."
josh_g says, "oh"
floyd | jdoe votes to lynch josh_g.
josh_g says, "well, still"
josh_g exclaims, "hey!"
brenbarn says, "my my."
jota says, "i'd guess josh, schep, and myself seem most likely to vote for the sae person. maybe jeff. but i don't think it's jeff or myself, so i'm guessing schep or josh_g. just a guess, of course."
josh_g says, "oh well, random violence is random violence"
jota says, "since josh has one, i'll balance it..."
floyd | jota votes to lynch schep.
josh_g says, "and since it's not me ..."
floyd | josh_g votes to lynch schep.
schep asks, "balance it? you want to balance it?"
miseri says, "erg."
jota says, "just a guess, btw. i don't know this for fact or anything."
floyd | schep votes to lynch jota.
brenbarn says, "this is tough. . ."
josh_g says, "hee"
schep says, "if you're following jota's logic, don't forget jota."
jota says (to schep), "i don't think it's me."
josh_g says, "hmm"
josh_g says, "last time we followed jota's logic, it was him :)"
schep says (to jota), "right, i'm talking to the people who seemed to jump on."
josh_g exclaims, "kill the logician!"

schep asks (of jota), "is that all?"
josh_g says (to jota), "again, but with _feeling_"
jota asks (of schep), "do you have any good reason to suspect me?"
josh_g says, "tsk tsk tsk"
josh_g says, "i've esplained already, the first round isn't about reason"
josh_g says, "it's about random mob violence"
schep says (to josh_g), "it can be."
josh_g says, "but if you guys have a reason, do tell"
brenbarn says, "c'"
schep says, "for that matter, we could kill the random one."
brenbarn says, "mon"
schep asks (of bb), "yes?"
jota says, "i'm willing to vote for schep or josh, if it'll make the round go faster. and if you can give me *good* evidence for soeone else, fine. but whichever way, it's not me."
