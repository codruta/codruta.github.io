hloif asks (of maga_dogg), "huh, why?"
brenbarn asks (of hloif), "now what?"
emily asks (of hloif), "er, is that a confession?"
maga_dogg says (to hloif), "gives villagefolk something to go on, lynchwise"
hloif says (to emily), "no, it's not.  i'm trying to be funny.  :("
hloif asks (of maga_dogg), "anyway, what's the logic with the seer stepping forward?"
brenbarn asks, "if we're wrong, we die, right?"
maga_dogg says (to hloif), "what bren said."
brenbarn says, "hmmm, so vig and wolf both targeted schep"
hloif says, "okay, then, i'm the seer, and emily is a vigilante."
