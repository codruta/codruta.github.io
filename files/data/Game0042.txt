floyd | a new game begins with 7 players composed of 2 werewolves, 1 seer, 1
floyd | wolfsbane carrier, and 3 villagers.  now it is night; time for the
floyd | werewolves to kill, the seer to identify, the wolfsbane carrier to
floyd | protect and the rest to sleep.
ender arrives, full of funk, but no fun.
schep says, "d'oh"
ender asks, "am i too late?"
maga_dogg says (to ender), "yep"
brenbarn says, "only just"
ender says, "never mind."
maga_dogg says (to ender), "sorry"
hloif says, "we could start over."
hloif says, "we just started."
ender says, "don't bother"
rob says, "we could start over, yeah."
ender has had his fill of playing for now, and goes back to the lounge.
rob says, "oh well."
maga_dogg says, "start ov- damn"
floyd | hloif, a villager, grins up at you from a lifeless skull.
floyd | it is now day. time to vote on whom to lynch.
parsergirl says, "i'm a villager"
maga_dogg says, "me too"
brenbarn says, "hmm, baner didn't guess right, darn"
rob hmmmmms.
hloif looks like hannibal lecter's last patient.
parsergirl says, "yucky"
brenbarn says, "hmm, if we're wrong and baner is wrong too, we lose."
maga_dogg says, "deathly silence, nobody wanting to incriminate themselves"
floyd | maga_dogg votes to lynch parsergirl.
rob says, "yeah, things are already looking pessimistic"
rob asks (of maga_dogg), "why?"
floyd | parsergirl votes to lynch maga_dogg.
brenbarn says, "pg is always suspicious, but, then, so is maga"
maga_dogg says, "too quick to call villager, too quick to say yucky."
maga_dogg says, "and i've been wolf so often of late that it can't be me"
floyd | rob votes to lynch parsergirl.
schep says, "hm, if we know seer, one innocent, and baner (ideal case, of course), we'd have 2/3 chance of guessing a wolf."
parsergirl says (to maga), "i'm not a wolf for the same reasons you aren't"
brenbarn asks, "why not?"
floyd | brenbarn votes to lynch parsergirl.
maga_dogg remembers the number of people here who do maths, and hopes none are too hot on probability.
rob says, "heh"
brenbarn asks, "hopes?"
schep says (to maga_dogg), "i am. ha ha."
floyd | brenbarn retracts a vote for parsergirl.
maga_dogg says, "(it makes f/a difference how many times i've been wolf of late)"
rob says, "i'm going along with the 'quick to call villager' thesis"
brenbarn says, "especially on first day"
parsergirl says, "sigh."
schep says, "don't kill pg."
parsergirl says, "i'm not a wolf, i'm a villager."
maga_dogg says, "but nonetheless, my accusations stand"
schep says, "because she's absolutely a villager."
rob asks, "is she innocent?"
brenbarn asks (of schep), "are you seer?"
schep says, "yup"
floyd | rob retracts a vote for parsergirl.
parsergirl says (to schep), "thank you."
maga_dogg says, "fuck"
brenbarn says, "hmmm."
floyd | maga_dogg retracts a vote for parsergirl.
rob says, "baner is likely to protect schep next turn"
rob says, "maybe we should vote maga_dogg instead"
floyd | maga_dogg votes to lynch rob.
rob says, "hey, i said maybe"
schep says, "well. assuming we get a wolf. if not, it's more a guessing game."
emily says, "maga_dogg seems pretty hot under the collar"
maga_dogg says, "i'm going on another instinct here"
floyd | parsergirl changes vote from maga_dogg to emily.
maga_dogg says (to emily), "i always do"
schep says, "i can't remember if maga_dogg always votes so much."
rob says, "we really do not want to string up a villager at this point"
brenbarn says, "he does"
maga_dogg says (to schep), "yes."
emily says (to parsergirl), "don't do that"
brenbarn says, "i have to leave in a few minutes"
maga_dogg says, "makes a game more quick-moving"
rob says, "let's vote brenbarn then"
parsergirl asks (of emily), "why not?"
schep says, "well, you shouldn't."
brenbarn asks, "me?"
floyd | schep votes to lynch maga_dogg.
emily says (to parsergirl), "because it'd be a bad idea"
floyd | maga_dogg changes vote from rob to schep.
rob says, "well, if you have to go soon"
floyd | parsergirl changes vote from emily to brenbarn.
schep says (to maga_dogg), "fool"
schep asks, "i'm seer, remember?"
floyd | emily votes to lynch maga_dogg.
rob says, "okay, now it's really tempting to vote maga_dogg"
floyd | maga_dogg changes vote from schep to emily.
brenbarn says, "well, the game's not going to be very long anyway"
floyd | rob votes to lynch maga_dogg.
floyd | parsergirl changes vote from brenbarn to maga_dogg.
