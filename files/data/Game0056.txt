maga_dogg says, "if i am the seer, ctate is a villager."
boingball says, "if i am seer, maga_dogg is a villager."
brenbarn says, "hmm, nothing juicy"
skip says (to brenbarn), "i have a lemon here..."
boingball says, "i didn't think the point was to point villagers, but hey"
brenbarn says, "ctate and hloif have yet to make their if-thens"
ctate asks, "wossa if-then?"
hloif says, "oh, sorry..."
maga_dogg says (to boingball), "well, if the seer did point a villager, it makes sense"
hloif says, "well, if golrien is a villager, i'm a villager."
schep says (to hloif), "nice"
ctate has no idea what's going on.
maga_dogg says (to ctate), "you say, "if i'm the seer, then x is a y", where x is a player and y is a class."
brenbarn says, "i've noticed that non-seers have a tendency to make their fake identify-ee a villager to avoid drawing attention to themselves"
golrien says, "if i'm a villager, margaret thatcher is dead."
brenbarn says (to ctate), "if you're the seer, tell the truth, if not, make something up"
skip says (to brenbarn), "but that's a false negative."
hloif says (to golrien), "quiet you."
boingball says (to brb), "you started it"
ctate says, "if i'm a seer, maga_dogg is a wolf."
maga_dogg says, "aiieee"
brenbarn says (to boing), "indeed"
brenbarn says, "aha"
maga_dogg says (to ctate), "okay, that makes you a villager, then"
<ddyte> pantalones sana in pulpo sano
boingball asks (of m_d), "does it? why not a wolf?"
brenbarn says, "okay, so potential seer protection is given to boing, hloif, ctate, maga"
maga_dogg says (to boingball), "it was a joke, not a real supposition"
brenbarn asks, "we have a devil too, right?"
ctate says, "yes"
brenbarn says, "hmmm"
ctate says, "two wolves, one devil"
boingball says, "people fling around far more ridiculous logic during these games"
ctate says, "one baner, one seer"
maga_dogg says (to bb), "yay ridiculous logic"
brenbarn says, "hrm"
brenbarn asks, "any ideas?"
skip says (to brenbarn), "there's always the "lynch someone at random" strategy."
maga_dogg says (to brenbarn), "first round random lynch it is, then"
skip closes his eyes, spins around, and points to someone.
you scoop up the dice, and rattle them around a bit.
you roll the dice on the floor. the red one comes up 5, and the green one comes up 1.
(from maga_dogg) skip says, "oh, wait. me."
schep says, "well, no one said anything about brenbarn or skip. er, or me."
boingball votes to lynch someone.
golrien says, "5+1=sixth player."
ctate says (to maga), "hee hee"

hloif says, "no one's voted yet.  because no one knows anything."
maga_dogg rolls his trusty d6
floyd | maga_dogg votes to lynch hloif.
floyd | hloif votes to lynch maga_dogg.
maga_dogg says (to hloif), "now, how did i expect that reaction... ;)"
hloif asks (of maga_dogg), "because you voted to lynch a villager?"
boingball says, "nobody ever does in the first round, unless a huge mistake is made"
hloif says (to maga_dogg), "we both know you're not a villager, so why don't you lynch someone else."
brenbarn asks (of hloif), "?"
skip flips a coin to decide who to lynch.
maga_dogg asks (of hloif), "?"
skip asks (of maga), "you want heads or tails?"
hloif says (to maga_dogg), "you're not a villager and you know it."
maga_dogg says (to skip), "heads"
<thrax> davis appears especially perplexed, which is no wonder: the film asks her to play a warm, traitorous, kindhearted, shrewish, man-hungry, fact-bending, deferential careerist.
ctate asks (of skip), "that's a rather personal question, don't you think?"
floyd | schep votes to lynch hloif.
maga_dogg says, "wolves have tails"
skip says (to maga), "heads it is."
floyd | skip votes to lynch hloif.
floyd | hloif changes vote from maga_dogg to hloif.
