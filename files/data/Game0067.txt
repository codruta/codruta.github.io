brenbarn says (to ctate), "you do 'wf wolf 1"

golrien says, "so we have baner and wolf, plus two villagers."
maga_dogg says, "this makes life difficult"
ctate scoops up the dice, and rattles them a bit.
ctate rolls a pair of dice on the floor. the red one comes up 6, and the green one comes up 4.
ctate watches the dice.
golrien says, "i claim villager."
maga_dogg says (to golrien), "so will everybody"
golrien says, "which leaves ctate, maga or brenbarn. or me, if i'm lying."
