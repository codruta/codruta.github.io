maga_dogg says, "agh"
marvin says, "bastards."
davidw says, "damn."
brenbarn says, "hmm"
boingball chuckles and munches popcorn
stacey says, "well, at least it wasn't the seer"
maga_dogg says, "so... it might be worth seer coming forwards with prediction straight away"
marvin says (to stacey), "how touching. i'd like that put on my gravestone, if you wouldn't mind."
stacey says (to marvin), "i'm sorry. it's only a game"
davidw asks, "there's just one wolf, right?"
marvin says, "and i'm not really annoyed."
stacey says, "here lies marvin - he saved the world a lot"
brenbarn says, "well, obviously if the seer knows the wolf, he should say so"
maga_dogg says, "that'd leave, unh, three candidates"
thrax asks, "play 'if i'm a seer'?"
maga_dogg says, "probably too many"
maga_dogg says (to brenbarn), "well duh"
stacey says, "i guess the seer doesn't know the wolf"
brenbarn says, "schepler maneuver sounds good"
thrax says, "if i'm a seer, brenbarn is innocent"
maga_dogg says, "iias, thrax is a villager."
brenbarn says, "if i'm the seer, stacey is innocent"
stacey says, "iias, brenbarn is innocent"
davidw asks, "sorry, how is this helping?"
stacey says, "it doesn't really"
thrax says (to dw), "not much now, but it will later."
maga_dogg says (to davidw), "if the seer dies, we can look back and check what he said"
thrax says (to dw), "particularly if we lose the seer--right"
brenbarn says, "now let's lynch maga_dogg anyway"
davidw says, "oh. didn't know that."
brenbarn says, "heh heh"
maga_dogg exclaims, "hey!"
brenbarn asks, "anybody got any real ideas?"
thrax says, "not really"
davidw says, "no. sorry."
maga_dogg says (to bren), "well, this is the first round"
stacey says, "i never know how to vote"
