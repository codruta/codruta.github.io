floyd | a new game begins with 7 players composed of 2 werewolves, 1 seer, and
floyd | 4 villagers.  now it is night; time for the werewolves to kill, the
floyd | seer to identify and the rest to sleep.
brenbarn asks, "who's holding up the wheels of progress?"
floyd | thazz, a villager, is dead.
floyd | it is now day. time to vote on whom to lynch.
brenbarn says, "hrm"
thazz cries!
marten says, "hmm"
guest1 exclaims, "poor thazz... poor bro!"
(from thazz) thazz's corpse goes to pout in a corner.
julian says, "yeah, we've seen *your* filial love for each other."
brenbarn asks, "heck, we have to be right, huh?"
brenbarn says, "that's hardcore"
guest1 says, "cry cry cry... who killed my bro? ;=)"
floyd | julian votes to lynch guest1.
marten exclaims, "well, better do it right this time!"
floyd | traevoli votes to lynch guest1.
brenbarn asks, "what?"
floyd | marten votes to lynch guest1.
brenbarn says, "don't be all hasty"
traevoli says, "there doesn't seem to be a lot of love in this family."
dglasser says (to julian), "don't be too quick to jump!@"
brenbarn says, "so i'm assuming the seer didn't id a wolf"
julian says (to dglasser), "but she's too loud! ... ok."
brenbarn asks, "is it worth it for them to come out anyway?"
marten says, "well, if he had there would be a better argument now"
<skip> you're just jealous because the voices are talking to me.
traevoli exclaims, "i'm the seer!  i identified myself as a wolf!"
brenbarn says, "hee hee"
traevoli gets himself lynched.
guest1 exclaims, "hey ! hoe! don't lynch me wrongly like last time!!!"
julian says, "traevoli =)"
marten exclaims, "we'll just keep lynching you 'till we get it right! it's the american way!"
brenbarn says, "if seer knows an innocent, that leaves 4 people"
jarb has had his fill of playing for now, and goes back to the lounge.
julian says, "actually, guest1 *is* the wolf."
brenbarn says, "which gives us a 50-50 chance"
guest1 pouts! julian is the wolf!
traevoli says, "that would be truly sick.  a devil who can kill.  i suppose you'd have to have a seer who could be a vigilante."
julian exclaims, "recriminations!"
<steve> the new food-like substances have less of everything, which makes them more costly, but worth it.
</liza> i am so embarrassed about my giraffe
julian says, "traevoli ... i didn't follow that.  sorry."
brenbarn says, "if the seer idd thazz, that leaves 5 possible wolves"
brenbarn says, "but dude, if we're wrong, we die"
brenbarn asks, "who's the seer?"
boingball arrives, full of funk, but no fun.

guest1 asks, "i would be way too loudmouthed for a wolf , wouldn't i?"
brenbarn asks, "why did you all vote for guest1?"
dglasser asks (of julian), "why are you saying that?"
marten asks, "isn't it a bit early to play if i were seer?"
julian says (to guest1), "no, i think you're loudmouthed enough."
floyd | guest1 votes to lynch julian.
brenbarn says (to marten), "if we guess wrong, there's no tomorrow"
brenbarn asks, "who's the seer, man?"
traevoli says (to brenbarn), "because she laughed at her brother's death."
guest1 exclaims, "laughs! pleeaase, don't lynch me again!"
marten asks, "is there one or two wolves?"
guest1 says, "and no, i cried"
brenbarn says, "2"
julian says (to marten), "two."
marten exclaims, "dang!"
dglasser says, "(wf rules)"
julian says, "ok, i'm worried, but the seer isn't coming forward.  guest1 seems likely..."
marten asks, "so, if we guess wrong this round, that's it?"
brenbarn says, "yes"
brenbarn says, "i don't see that guest1 did anything particularly wolfish"
julian asks, "wait a second!  who died and made brenbarn moderator?  what if *he* and guest1 are wolves!?"
julian says, "she exaggerated her response to the death."
traevoli recaps, "guest1 said 'cry cry cry... who killed my bro? ;=)' sounds sarcastic to me."
marten says, "lay off him julian, he's trying to help"
julian says, "and you're trying to protect her."
julian says, "sigh.  ok.  nevermind."
dglasser says (to julian), "you're getting pretty violent yourself"
marten says, "yeah, i have to admit julian is making himself damn suspicious"
julian says, "sorry."
brenbarn says, "bah"
traevoli says, "we're all a little noose-happy.  seeing as what's happened in the nearby towns."
guest1 asks, "no it's just the sad sister thing! bah! none of you has sisters?"
julian asks, "now wait a second!  i've been lynched *twice* for acting the same way!  where'd that get us?"
julian says (to guest1), "i have a sister."
traevoli does, too.
guest1 says, "poor girl..."
boingball does, but he's not playing.
traevoli says, "i doubt my sister would smile at my murder."
julian says (to guest1), "but she's not rude, unlike some i've encountered."
julian says (to guest1), "=)"
guest1 exclaims, "pouts... thazz, say something!"
brenbarn says, "thazz is dead"
thazz doesn't say anything. he's dead.
traevoli says, "y'know consistency is a good camoflauge for werewolves."
traevoli says, "not that we're supposed to take into account people's playing style from previous games..."
guest1 cries as bren reminds her cruelly of her brother's death...
brenbarn says, "3 people are voting for guest"
julian says, "ok, i'll stop acting this way."
julian asks, "how do i unvote?"
boingball says, "unvote <person>"
floyd | julian retracts a vote for guest1.
brenbarn says, "since i'm not a wolf, at one of those 3 must be a wolf, or dg and guest1 are wolves"
boingball says, "<person> is probably optional"
julian says, "dg?  yes, he's quiet... and so is marten."
marten says, "well, i'm not a wolf, and since julian just tried to draw attention away from himself ...."
julian says, "huhn.  everyone who claims not be a wolf, please raise your hand."
dglasser says, "i may be quiet but that's because i'm distracted"
brenbarn says, "why doesn't the seer reveal themselves?  it can't hurt -- well, it might hurt tomorrow, but if there's no tomorrow, who cares about that"
dglasser says, "i'm a villager"
traevoli raises his hand.
julian says, "well, that was a rhetorical request."
brenbarn asks (of traevoli), "you're seer?"
julian raises his hand.
brenbarn says, "oh, sorry, misread"
traevoli says (to brenbarn), "i'm not a wolf."
marten says, "well then, let's forsake my little life here and let me tell you that brenbarn is not a wolf, and i am the soon to be dead seer"
brenbarn says, "excellent"
julian says, "the seer really could turn this game into a 50-50, which is better than not."
julian says, "what brenbarn said."
brenbarn says, "now all you guys have to do is pick someone else and you'll have a 50-50 chance"
guest1 exclaims, "nods to marten... so, i bet for julian!"
brenbarn says, "i suppose that means guest1 is as reasonable as any"
marten says, "yes, that's what i thought"
floyd | brenbarn votes to lynch guest1.
julian says, "i'll go with brenbarn, then."
floyd | julian votes to lynch guest1.
