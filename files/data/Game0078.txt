ctate says, "i have no idea how things go fro here :)"
davidw says, "that's pretty cool."
maga_dogg says, "well, i bet the baner had a really hard choice of who to bane ;)"
duchess says, "er baner"
brenbarn says, "heh"
boingball says, "hmm. baner probably protected themselves, so the wolves know who it is."
ctate says, "does this mean the wolves know who the ... timing"

boingball says, "you two are as bad as marvin and me"
davidw says, "that's democratic."
ctate says, "heh"
emily says, "well, um, someone has to die here with no evidence"
maga_dogg says, "first-round random voting..."
<veek> you think you're so smart, but i've seen you naked.
ctate says, "right, unless the baner speaks up"
brenbarn asks, "why would he?"
maga_dogg asks, "you all know what i'm thinking, right?"
necro-phil says, "<insert fight club reference here>"
ctate says (to bren), "hey, i haven't played this much... ;)"
davidw asks, "if the baner spoke up, s/he'd have to protect themselves all the time, right?"
brenbarn says, "yeah"
emily says, "presumably the wolves know who the baner is already, though"
necro-phil says, "skip is a communist"
emily says, "um, unless the baner protected someone else"
boingball says, "right... they usually protect themselves"
brenbarn says, "hmm, this could lead to stalemate"
necro-phil exclaims, "lynch the commie!"
boingball says (to necro), "hey there al"
maga_dogg asks (of necro), "we're all communists here. didn't skip tell you?"
davidw asks, "does this mean both wolves attacked the same person?"
emily says, "but the baner speaking up would still be good because then, statistically, we have a better chance of picking a wolf to lynch"
ctate says (to dw), "the wolves have to agree on whom to kill"
maga_dogg says (to davidw), "no, only one attack for all the wolves"
emily says (to davidw), "wolves attack only one/night"
ctate is the baner
brenbarn says, "hmmm"
maga_dogg asks, "hrm. and who'd you bane?"
emily asks, "any counterclaimants?"
necro-phil says, "no, my wang is far to small to be al's."
ctate says (to maga), "myself, ofc"
maga_dogg says (to ctat), "good man"
ctate says (to maga), "if i'd baned someone else, i wouldn't have spoken up"
davidw asks, "hmm. who'd attack ctate?"
ctate says (to dw), "maga_dogg's ticked that i haven't gotten his beta-testing as far along as he'd liked, so maybe it's him... ;)"
brenbarn says, "a twisted psychopath"
<dglasser> dglasser has connected to ifmud.
davidw says, "duchess is awfully quiet."
duchess says, "i believe ctate only because no one disagrees with me"
maga_dogg says, "well, not me, because of his sterling betatesting work. and not skip, because he;d kill necro, and not necro, cause he'd kill skip."
duchess says, "me=him"
duchess says (to davidw), "you aren't on my channels"
ctate says (to brenbarn), "a twisted psychopath?  on ifmud?  i laugh at you!  ha!  ha ha!"
necro-phil says, "skip = foghat"
<hjalfi> d035 ne1 h334 5p33k 1337?
maga_dogg says, "but necro is making himself more tempting-to-lynch by the second"
emily says, "hmmmm"
brenbarn says (to maga), "hmm, your logic is good with regard to skip and necro"
duchess says, "i say we lynch the one who has done the most talking"
necro-phil asks, "and hjalfi isn't?"
duchess says, "yay, i actually managed to spell 'say' correctly"
maga_dogg says (to brenbarn), "also, ridiculously obvious"
boingball says, "good logic usually is"

ctate says, "aha, thanks"
boingball says, "it's just necro and skip on each other though"

boingball asks, "er. do we *have* a seer?"
ctate asks, "or just lynch someone?"

ctate says, "iias would probably be a nightmare with this many still"
emily says, "the whole point of iias is to play every turn"
floyd | davidw votes to lynch duchess.
necro-phil asks, "what is this mysterious iias?"
hloif says (to necro-phil), "it's a boring way of playing."
skip says, "you are saying 'if i am the seer, thus and such is a wolf', or something like that."
brenbarn says, "forget it, let's just kill someone"
maga_dogg says (to necro), "a statement of the form 'if i am a seer, then x is a y'"
