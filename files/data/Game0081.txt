miseri arrives, full of neither funk nor fun.
julian asks, "i think that everyone had motive, and opportunity, but which of us had the claws?"

ctate asks, "i bet people don't want to play iias...?"
ender asks, "all right, so... has anyone said anything relevant?"
julian says, "i would like to point out that, in my experience, werewolves are foolishly silent, and that ctate, hloif, and maga_dogg have all been very silent."
andyf asks, "so, anyone say anything odd right after the killing?"
hloif says (to ctate), "i normally prefer not to."
maga_dogg says (to julian), "like hell i have"

hloif says (to julian), "you do seem pretty eager to lynch someone..."
andyf says, "(er, to julina)"
julian peers suspiciously at hloif.
maga_dogg says (to julian), "also, you are voting on no evidence at all, which is quite all right on the first round as long as it isn't voting for me"
marvin says, "if i am the seer, julian is a villager."
ctate says, "heh"
julian exclaims, "this isn't no evidence!  this is lengthy werewolve experience!  i *know* these creatures!"

julian says, "oh, fine, i'll be quiet.  but i'm not a werewolf, and if you lynch me you'll be 4-to-2, and then 2-to-2, and then you'll be dead.  so there."
