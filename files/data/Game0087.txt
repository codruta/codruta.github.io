floyd | a new game begins with 6 players composed of 1 werewolf, 1 seer, 1
floyd | magistrate, and 3 villagers.  now it is night; time for the werewolf
floyd | to kill, the seer to identify, the magistrate to protect and the rest
floyd | to sleep.
julian asks, "magistrate seems kind of funny.  why can't the magistrate protect someone during the day, to avert a lynching?"
brenbarn says, "hm!"
matthew says, "but i don't understand why rob didn't survive."
brenbarn says, "let's see how this goes"
floyd | rob, a villager, grins up at you from a lifeless skull.
floyd | it is now day. time to vote on whom to lynch.
floyd | brenbarn is protected from lynching today.
rob has had his fill of playing for now, and goes back to the lounge.
matthew says, "eeep, rob."
brenbarn says, "poor rob"
julian says, "indeed, he shall be missed."
reillyb says, "truly"
floyd | julian votes to lynch brenbarn.
<kalthare> kalthare has connected to ifmud.
brenbarn says, "i'm protected, man"
matthew asks (of julian), "wait, why?"
julian says, "i'm just playing."
maga_dogg says, "experimenting"
</rob> find release from your cares. have a good time.
julian says, "funny that it allows me to vote for him."
floyd | julian retracts a vote for brenbarn.
brenbarn says, "you can vote but you can't win!"
floyd | julian votes to lynch reillyb.
brenbarn says, "um"
</lennier> "name most a tool, emu!"
maga_dogg asks, "hmm. iias?"
brenbarn says, "sure"
brenbarn says, "if i'm seer, reillyb is innocent"
maga_dogg says, "iias, matthew is innocent."
matthew says, "yes, i'm innocent."
brenbarn says, "heh"
julian says, "i'm not going to support my vote for reillyb."
reillyb says, "neither am i"
brenbarn asks (of julian), "what does that mean?"
julian says (to brenbarn), "oh, nevermind."
floyd | julian retracts a vote for reillyb.
julian says, "but i'd appreciate if the seer, unless he has already spoken, would identify reillyb."
brenbarn asks, "what?"
brenbarn says, "obviously seer should come out if he knows the wolf.  otherwise. . ."
maga_dogg asks (of julian), "why, exactly? is this just general newbie-fear?"
julian says, "ok, specifically, and perhaps wrongly, it is fear of the delay that someone took this last night."
brenbarn says, "that wasn't much of a delay"
julian says, "wasn't it?  well, i've retracted my vote.  also reillyb's shortness."
</dan_wood> in all seriousness, what the hell is iran going to do with killer soviet dolphins?
brenbarn says, "(certainly compared to that absurdly long night yesterday)"
</ghogg> arrived in court last month wearing a half-kangaroo, half-clown costume
julian says (to brenbarn), "hee."
maga_dogg says, "hmm. julian's being a little overhasty"
maga_dogg says, "but then, this is the first round"
julian says, "yes, i'm starting to dislike first round."
brenbarn says, "then let's end it!  haha!"
floyd | julian votes to lynch reillyb.
brenbarn says, "i'm more inclined to think it's maga, but that's just 'cause he's such a wacky guy"
julian shrugs.
floyd | matthew votes to lynch reillyb.
brenbarn says (to matthew), "what do you -- aha"
floyd | maga_dogg votes to lynch reillyb.
