floyd | a new game begins with 6 players composed of 1 werewolf, 1 seer, 1
floyd | magistrate, and 3 villagers.  now it is night; time for the werewolf
floyd | to kill, the seer to identify, the magistrate to protect and the rest
floyd | to sleep.
julian says, "ok."
matthew asks (of schep), "don't like playing with a magistrate?"
schep says, "wait, i confused magistrate and vigilante."
floyd | brenbarn, a seer, looks like the result of using a blender in entirely
floyd | the wrong way.
floyd | it is now day. time to vote on whom to lynch.
schep says, "ow"
brenbarn says, "argh"
julian says, "eep"
maga_dogg says, "crud"
julian says, "ok, no iias."
maga_dogg says, "darn it"
schep says, "it would be fairly pointless."
maga_dogg says, "errr... this is tricky"
julian says, "i'd suppose so... hm."
julian asks, "i'm kinda still in favour of schep... hey, why hasn't anyone been protected?"
maga_dogg asks, "wait, magistrate didn't protect?"
<caleb> tunes in.
julian says, "apparently not."
schep says, "in favour? aw, how nice."
maga_dogg says, "this makes life silly"
julian asks, "err, favor?"
schep says, "same thing"
julian says, "oh, good."
julian says, "actually, wise for the magistrate not to protect."
schep asks, "you think so?"
julian says, "well, statistically it'd be good, i guess."
julian says, "certainly the magistrate could simplify the lynching by removing himself from the list of victims."
schep asks, "shall we vote randomly then?"
julian says, "sigh, yes."
floyd | schep votes to lynch maga_dogg.
floyd | maga_dogg votes to lynch schep.
maga_dogg says, "a simple enough choice..."
julian asks, "if i vote for either one of you, the werewolf (assuming that he is not one of you) will be the last necessary vote, yes?"
schep says, "erm, maybe."
schep says, "but jumping on immediately would be too obvious."
schep says, "since there is tomorrow."
julian says, "indeed."
julian says, "i guess that's a good trap, for some other game =)"
floyd | julian votes to lynch reillyb.
floyd | reillyb votes to lynch julian.
</adam> you must talk directly into the beak!
maga_dogg says, "hmm"
julian asks, "sigh.  does someone want to step forward as magistrate?"
floyd | maga_dogg retracts a vote for schep.
reillyb says, "i'm beginning to see a pattern here..."
julian asks (of reillyb), "hm?"
julian says, "oh, joke."
floyd | julian retracts a vote for reillyb.
floyd | reillyb retracts a vote for julian.
matthew says, "hrm."
julian says, "seriously, a known magistrate would help, and it would do the werewolf little good to kill the magistrate, i think."
schep says, "no, the wolf would kill the magistrate, if it's a known innocent."
julian asks (of schep), "why?"
schep says, "i have to advise against revealed magistrate."
matthew says, "okay, guys, you'd better lynch me.  i'm a villager, but i need to leave."
maga_dogg says (to julian), "because it's better than killing someone who might potentially be a wolf"
schep says, "the wolf always kills known innocents so that people have to vote on more unknowns."
julian says, "sigh, ok."
floyd | julian votes to lynch matthew.
julian says, "oh, i see."
schep says, "aw. suck game."
reillyb says, "then the magistrate couldn't protect anyone"
floyd | schep changes vote from maga_dogg to matthew.
julian says, "we'll have a funner next round, maybe."
matthew says, "sorry, i didn't know this one would go on so long or i wouldn't have started."
julian asks, "um, one person vote for matthew?"
floyd | maga_dogg votes to lynch matthew.
