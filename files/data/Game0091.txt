brenbarn says (to devil), "yes"
reillyb was afk making tea, not killing villagers
banichi asks, "hell, how do we make the decision this early?"
devil says, "no need for seer to come out yet, basically, there's no info to be gained from that except don't kill baner, s/he's lucky."
julian says, "well, we wait for evidence."
maga_dogg says, "hmm."
devil says, "i'm a villager, in case anyone was wondering."
marvin says, "plus, we have a fool. seer coming out is even more of a bad idea."

maga_dogg says (to devil), "i suppose wolves can be scrupulous about hygiene too"
brenbarn says, "they bathe in blood"
maga_dogg says (to brenbarn), "but no blood as yet :)"
reillyb asks, "don't villagers eat cabbages?"
devil uses wolfsbane soap every morn.
julian says, "iiab, brenbarn is something-or-other"
brenbarn says (to maga), "therefore the wolf cannot be clean and you are lying!"
maga_dogg says (to reillyb), "yeah, and they wear empty burlap sacks and screw pigs"
brenbarn asks, "iiab?  if i am beer?"
julian asks (of brenbarn), "blood is clean?"

brenbarn says, "no one's been suspiciously silent, i don't think"
caleb says, "um, me.  but i'm a villager again, so don't all lynch me this time"
julian says (to devil), "i know."
maga_dogg says, "everyone's been fairly talky, yeah"
maga_dogg says, "and silence is too obvious a cover for a wolf, as a rule"
julian says, "i would like to point out, also, that i have not been so talky as to be disguising a lupine nature."
brenbarn says, "pshaw"
devil says, "sigh."
reillyb says, "back"
maga_dogg says (to julian), "mmm, conformity"
maga_dogg says, "overconformity: a sure sign of a wolf"
schep says, "so there's not much, and julian pulled some weird stuff, and he's certainly not the seer."

julian remembers some odd movie with demons in it.
devil says, "dirtywolf"
brenbarn says, "the non-wolves can just shake their booties"
marvin says (to maga_dogg), "thank you for that."
maga_dogg says (to marvin), "i live to give"
brenbarn says, "moving on"
marvin says, "give elsewhere."
<ghogg> mind you, i have dibs on the starting the next nuclear war if they declare ebonics to be the universal language of earth.
julian shakes his booty.  good and silver, aye!
brenbarn says, "arr!"
devil says, "caleb hasn't talked much, as he himself admits."
schep says, "arrr."
caleb says, "true. but i don't see why this incriminates me.  last time i talked and got lynched"

maga_dogg says, "this is going to take a fucking age again"
devil says, "i'm still up for killing banichi, fwiw."
caleb says (to julian), "no, of course not"
devil says, "for no particularly good reason."
schep says, "well, i'm not particularly against bandwagoning at this stage, since there's almost no info."
julian says, "ok.  first point:  i'm *not* a wolf.  marvin and schep, please unvote."
banichi says, "well, let's pick someone and get going."

</steve> at this point the exasperated slobodan passes the handset to mira and she listens for a while.
reillyb says, "much like pg in the last game, i'm a villager"
marvin says (to julian), "random."
devil says, "well, (a) random, and (b) it's not me."
banichi says, "btw, i'm an upstanding member of this fine village community. :d"
julian asks (of marvin), "or wolfishness, hm?"
marvin says, "actually, no, you voted for devil, and i reckon he's innocent. so i voted for you."
devil says, "to be brutally honest."
marvin says, "then you said you were only joking. and i didn't care."
brenbarn says, "this game is all about brutality, honest or otherwise"
maga_dogg asks (of banichi), "upstanding, but on how many legs?"
julian says (to marvin), "that was a *joke*.  oh.  bleh."
devil says (to bren), "true."
brenbarn says (to maga), "hee hee"
marvin says, "it's the best reason i'm going to come up with on the first round."

<steve> mum, i'm changing all my teeth. i've got 29 teeth in my head, and i'm changing 29. i'm not fixing them, i'm changing them.
marvin asks, "short-spoken?"
brenbarn says (to banichi), "anything erectus sounds dirty"
marvin asks, "what the hell does that mean?"
maga_dogg asks (of banichi), "more so than homo erectus?"
julian breaks out his julian's neologisms to english dictionary.
